This repository contains the snapcraft build files that generate a function snap build of Joplin. Precompiled binaries can be downloaded at https://snapcraft.io/joplin-james-carroll or via `sudo snap install joplin-james-carroll`

Due to the nature of the Snap sandbox, the webclipper functionality is unlikely to work for the foreseeable future.

Joplins official site can be found at https://joplinapp.org/ and it's source repository at https://github.com/laurent22/joplin
